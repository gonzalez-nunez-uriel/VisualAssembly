# To Do List

## Urgent
Learn more about the specifics of MIPS assembly:
  * memory layout --> where and how the stack, heap, and text areas are layded out and how they grow
  * different dtypes
  * how labels are used

## Must be done in order
1) Implement sp registers
2) Implement jump instruction

## In no particular order

1. Change internal structure of Memory object to allow undo instruction.
